v7.1.1

* NOTE: The library now forces HTTP 1.1 or 2.0 connections using TLS version 1.2 only when communicating to all Janrain Servers
* Library dependencies updated:
  * 'com.android.support:support-v4:27.1.0'
  * files('libs/org.apache.http.legacy.jar')
  * 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.10.0'
  * 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-apache:3.10.0'
  * 'com.squareup.okio:okio:1.14.0'
  * 'net.openid:appauth:0.7.0'
* Google Sign In (Native sample app tested with Sign-In SDK Services version 3.1.2 and play-services-auth version 11.8.0).  NOTE: The Native sample app has been modified to work with the newer Google Sign-In Android SDK's.  It is no longer compatible with the Google+ Android SDK's.  If you want to use the older Google+ Android SDK's for native authentication please refer to a previous release.  The supporting methods for the older SDK's are still in place and should work.
  1. For Google Sign-In use: `Jump.startCodeAuthForNativeProvider(activity, "googleplus", authCode,"",activity.signInResultHandler,"");`
  1. For Google+ use: `Jump.startTokenAuthForNativeProvider(activity, "googleplus", googleToken,"",activity.signInResultHandler,"");`
* Facebook (Native sample app tested with Facebook Android SDK version 4.31.1 as per facebook's own documentation)
* Twitter (Native sample app tested Twitter SDK version 3.1.1)

v7.1

* Project files upgraded to Android Studio 3 (Also tested with Android Studio 2.3)
* Facebook (Native sample app tested with Facebook Android SDK version 4.+ as per facebook's own documentation)
* Google+ (Native sample app tested with Play/Sign-In SDK Services version 3.1.0 and Play Auth version 11.8.0)
* Twitter (Native sample app tested Twitter SDK version 3.1.1)
* Bug fixes to several library files to address crashes from null values.
* The sample apps have been heavily refactored.  They now load the library files from the top-level "Jump" folder in the repo instead of copying them to the app folder.
* The sample apps now optionally use a json configuration file loaded from the application's `res\raw\janrain_config.json` file.  The original method for intiallizing the libraries is still supported.
* The sample apps have been updated to use the latest version of the Janrain "standard" flow file.
* The sample app registration and profile forms have been updated to include all the form fields from the "standard" flow.  This includes methods for populating date-pickers and selection spinners/pickers.


v7.0.5

* Potentially BREAKING CHANGE: If you are using the "capture/CaptureRecord.java" file's "hasPassowrd()" method to determine if a user record is social only then the logic has been corrected.  "hasPassword()" now returns a Boolean true if the user record contains a password value other than null.
* Added code and examples to support the change password functionality of flow forms.  This includes a new method that allow the developer to build up a simple Map of flow form names and values and submit the form to any Janrain "oauth/" compatible endpoint.  This method does no validation that the submitted data is accurate for the flow form configuration.  All validation of the submitted data and error reporting will be done server-side.
```
public static CaptureApiConnection updateUserProfileWithFormFieldsProvided(Map<String, String> fieldMap,
                                                                               String oauthEndpoint,
                                                                               String captureFlowFormName,
                                                                               String accessToken,
                                                                               final CaptureApiRequestCallback handler)
```

NOTE:  This change requires adding an activity to your AndroidManifest.xml.  Please refer to the Docs/Upgrade_Guide.md for more assistance.
* Added extra verification for null/empty engageAppUrl settings.
* Updated sample applications to use the 0.5.1 version of the OpenID AppAuth Android libraries

* Improved error handling when the user denies access to the OpenID AppAuth permissions/scopes request.
* Added an example of invoking direct Engage authentication (Google) through the SimpleDemo main UI without needing to invoke the Engage Provider List Fragment.

* If you want to use the Janrain Mobile Libraries and Sample Code with the latest Android API levels there is now has dependencies on the deprecated org.apache.http.legacy.jar.
